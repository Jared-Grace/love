  "the couplets being put up for review this round, each with one line saying what was changed in it - the review page's whole subject, held apart from the page that draws it so that changing what is under review is an edit to a list and never to a layout";
  "a note travels with each number rather than the number travelling alone, because a picture shown by itself asks the reader to find the difference. What was changed is the one thing the person reviewing cannot see and the one thing whoever changed it already knows, so withholding it spends their attention on a question that was already answered.";
  "the note says the fault that is still there as well as the one that was fixed, and that is the half worth defending. A page that lists only what improved is asking to be agreed with; a reader told the picture is still wrong in a named way can look at the rest of it instead of rediscovering that.";
  "a couplet comes off this list the moment it is accepted, so what is here is only what is still open. Leaving an accepted picture up spends a reader's attention on a question they have already answered, and it hides how much is left.";
  "this list is meant to be short-lived and rewritten every round, which is why it is a list of its own and not a field on the couplet table. A couplet's symbol is permanent and what somebody was asked to look at last Tuesday is not.";
  "AN EMPTY LIST IS THE FINISHED STATE AND NOT A BROKEN ONE, so the page that reads it has to say so in words rather than come up blank. Every couplet that has been drawn so far has been accepted, and the next round begins by putting numbers back here - so emptiness means the reviewing is caught up with the drawing, which is the one state worth telling the reader about plainly.";
  "A NOTE IS THREE OR FOUR SHORT SENTENCES AND NEVER A PARAGRAPH. The reader is holding a phone with the picture above and the note in grey beneath it, and a note long enough to need scrolling costs more attention than the picture it is about. Everything worth keeping that will not fit belongs in the prose of the function that was changed, where it is read once by whoever changes it next rather than every round by the person reviewing.";
  "IF THE READER ASKED A QUESTION, THE NOTE ANSWERS IT BEFORE IT SAYS ANYTHING ELSE. Four couplets were asked what was wrong with the drawing being replaced and all four got a fresh wording instead of an answer, which is the one reply that cannot be checked - a reader who is told why is able to say no, and a reader handed a new picture can only start again. The question is also worth taking literally: on three of the four the honest answer was that nothing was wrong with it and the replacement was somebody's unasked judgement.";
  "EVERY ATTEMPT STORES THE WORDING IT WAS DRAWN FROM, IN ITS OWN JSON BESIDE THE PNG, AND THAT IS WHAT A PICTURE IS JUDGED AGAINST. Couplet 24 was called a failure for having no open tomb in it, when the symbol in force when it was drawn asked for the tomb sealed and the light coming out past the sealing stone - so it had obeyed exactly. A window whose design has been changed once will have older drawings that are faithful to the older design and newer ones faithful to the newer, and judging both against whatever is in the file today marks the faithful ones wrong. Read the attempt json first.";
  "A DRAWING KEPT FROM BEFORE A WORDING CHANGED IS NOT EVIDENCE ABOUT THAT WORDING. Couplet 18 was reported as having no halo and no scroll while its symbol asked for both, because the kept attempt predated the scroll being written in at all. Before reading a fault off a picture, check that the picture was drawn from the words now in the file.";

      note: "80 is up now, as you asked. One thing to know: its black field is not what the wording says - that still asks for emerald green between the lead lines and deep crimson below. So if 11 is ever redrawn it will come back green, not black. Say the word and I will write the black in with your reason for it.",

      note: "This is 260, your fallback - the extra batch did not find the glow again. Five draws: two tinted the halo faintly, one made it a flat yellow ring, one left it white, one lost the light. What 260 costs you is the window: it is cropped, so the arch runs off both sides instead of standing on black with its white band round it. Thirty draws say that glow and that arch have not yet come back in the same picture.",
